#A PersistentVolume (PV) is a volume plugins like Volumes, 
#but have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the PV. 

#The configuration file specifies that the volume is at /media/pi on the cluster’s Node. 

#The configuration also specifies a size of 10 gibibytes and an access mode of ReadWriteOnce, 
#which means the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Node. 

#It defines the StorageClass name manual for the PersistentVolume, 
#which will be used to bind PersistentVolumeClaim requests to this PersistentVolume.
